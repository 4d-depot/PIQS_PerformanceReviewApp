# Perfomance Review Application

Welcome to the GitHub repository associated with our tutorial series dedicated to creating high-performance web applications with 4D Qodly Pro and 4D Server. This project is designed as an educational resource to illustrate the concepts and features covered throughout the series.

To make our examples practical and concrete, we have developed a typical web application that covers the essential aspects of development with 4D Qodly Pro. This application will allow you to:
- Enter data: Users can enter and manage information through intuitive web interfaces.
- Generate documents: Using custom templates created with 4D Write Pro, the application automatically generates documents.
- Export to PDF: Convert the generated documents into PDF files for simplified distribution.
- Display documents: Provide users with the ability to preview documents directly within the application.
